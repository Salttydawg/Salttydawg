## About me ðŸ‘‹

**Salttydawg/Salttydawg** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CS50 course through edX
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Scratch and basics of coding
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on games
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything coding related 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my background as a musician
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tylar.salter@arbor.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him, but I'll never be HIM
- âš¡ Fun fact: My wife just got mad at my dog because he stole her bread. He then got scared and spilled an orange soda drink all over his white fur. This is literally happening as I type this... I need to help my wife clean this up...
